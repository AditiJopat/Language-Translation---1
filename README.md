This project is a full-stack web application designed for translating English text into another language using a custom machine learning model. The frontend is built using React and TypeScript, styled with Material UI for a clean and responsive user interface. It features user authentication, including signup, login, and password reset functionalities, as well as a profile page and translation history view. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database to store user data and translation history. The application integrates with a Python-based server that runs a trained translation model to process the actual language conversion. Users can enter English text and receive real-time translations, with all interactions and history managed through secure API routes. Overall, the project showcases the integration of modern frontend technologies, robust backend architecture, and machine learning for delivering an intelligent translation solution.
